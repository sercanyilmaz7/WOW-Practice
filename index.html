  <h3>GAME RULES</h3><br>
  <h5>General Provisions</h5>
      <p><br>
      1. In order to register, players must be thirteen (13) years of age or older. All players are solely responsible for their behavior in both public and battle chat. Players are responsible for protecting their accounts from access by others, and are strongly encouraged to select a hard-to-guess password and not re-use that password on any other sites where it may be read by the owners or administrators of that site. It is highly discouraged for users to share accounts with others. In the case of an account that has been lost or hacked, please inform technical support immediately through their website, Support.

If you are under 13 years of age or other minimum legal age where it differs under local legal requirements, please ask your parent or guardian to review and approve this EULA on your behalf. If you are under the aforesaid age, you must not use or access the Game without a parent or legal guardian supervising you.

<br><br> 2. The developers (Wargaming.net) of this software are not responsible for the behavior of any individual player, as well as for the content of his or her messages in all game chats and channels. Players are solely responsible for their behavior and the content of their messages in all game chats and channels.

<br><br>3. Wargaming.net reserves the right to evaluate each incident on a case by case basis. The action that may be taken may be more lenient or more severe than those listed under each category.

<br><br>4. Wargaming.net may suspend, terminate, modify, or delete accounts at any time for any reason or for no reason, with or without notice to the owner of the account. Accounts terminated by Wargaming.net for any type of abuse, including without limitation a violation of these rules or the EULA, will not be reactivated for any reason. For purposes of explanation and not limitation, most account suspensions, terminations and/or deletions are the result of violations of these rules, the End User License Agreement (EULA), or other Wargaming.net policy. Players may cancel any account registered to themselves at any time by following the instructions on the Website. Wargaming.net may stop offering and/or supporting any service at any time.

<br><br>5. Players who decide to be involved with the game acknowledge and agree to these and all other relevant rules and will abide by them regardless of the circumstances. In addition players also agree that these Rules will apply to anyone that is allowed to use their Wargaming.net account or user ID. By allowing another user to use the account, the account owner is personally responsible for all the consequences (including termination of said account) which may result, if the above discussed person violates any of the listed rules at any time. The account owner will not be entitled to a refund of any currency or any form of credit.

<br><br>6. Administration does not bear responsibility for any inter-clan relationship. It is at sole discretion of clan leaders, their deputies, and officers to carefully choose clan members (especially whilst assigning clan members to important offices such as the clan treasury). By assigning a clan member to a respective office clan leader confirms his confidence in the member. Privates, from their side, confirm that they accept clan rules and regulations by entering the respective clan. Note, that in the event of a conflict within a clan, information, such as treasury logs (and similar) will not be provided on request.
